# Retro gaming :: a modern version of Atari Pong! written in Go with Ebiten

![Build](https://github.com/creativeprojects/goboing/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is my first attempt at coding a retro game in go. Come to think of it, that's my very first attempt at coding any kind of game in any language :)

The graphics and audio are taken from the excellent "code the classics" book. The code is different.
